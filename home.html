        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>What first sparked my interest toward technology was when my parents would purchase a new electrical appliance. From computers to surround-sound speaker systems, my parents would let me take over and explore the workings of each device. Throughout elementary school, I would apply this knowledge in my computer classes so by my junior-high graduation, I had received an Academic Excellence award in Computing. By the end of high school, I had obtained six credit hours for <strong>AP Java AB</strong> as well as an Academic Excellence award in Honors Java and an Honorable Mention (&quot;iDesk&quot;) for the <strong>2007 Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision Awards Program</strong>. Today, I am the go-to guy for quick help to both friends and family. I recently helped two of my closest friends from high school who have served as IT specialists at JMU, GMU, and the Government Printing Office. Now I am finished with my <strong>BS in Computer Science</strong> at William and Mary.</p>

        <p>What has helped me reach this point is my personal motivation. When my parents purchased my first computer, once again I quickly discovered all the many wonders one could do with it. One of these was a social network(formerly known as &quot;Piczo&quot;) that allowed you to customize every aspect of the website you were given. While traveling along other websites finding out how I could customize my own, I soon learned the basics of the <strong>HTML</strong> language by seventh grade. Similarly, I have recently participated in two open source programs that force you to write your own code. With one, called <strong>Rainmeter</strong>, I created another layer to Windows that contains updates on my RSS feeds, music, weather, date, and time. On another, <strong>Autohotkey</strong>, I have reduced typing as much as possible by creating my own scripts to certain keystrokes. Both of these programs have their own scripting languages that I have learned on my leisure time.</p>
        <p>However, this does not mean that I spend all of my free time on technology. I also enjoy spending time with my fellow peers. In high school, I performed in all the plays and musicals, including lead actor roles, and received multiple award nominations. In my senior year, I was elected <strong>Secretary of the Drama Club</strong> and asked to improve communication between its members and leaders. Therefore, I established an email database of all its members and sent important announcements to them every week. Finally, for my theatre program that meets over the summer, I co-created its website to provide information on performances and tickets.</p>

        <p>Though I still am interested in theatre today, I am focusing more on technology. Coming into spring of my sophomore year, I had no knowledge of the languages <strong>C</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> and the operating system <strong>Linux</strong> but was told that they were all required for my <strong>Algorithms</strong> and <strong>Systems Programming</strong> classes. Starting from scratch, I was forced to not only learn them within weeks but to write complicated programs with them. Despite working early on the projects, I would be writing hundreds of lines on the night before the deadline with fellow members of the CS department. At the end of it all, I received an A in Algorithms and a B in Systems Programming which included an online game of <a href="https://github.com/b0ses/nim.d">Nim</a> over the internet via terminal. When it comes to these large problems, I would do everything in my power to get the job done, even if that includes viewing it from a different angle. While I got my BS in Computer Science from William and Mary, I double majored in <strong>Philosophy</strong>, improving my problem-solving and critical thinking abilities.</p>
		<p>Well, aside from working a full year at Booz Allen Hamilton as a consultant, web developer and designer, that's where I am at this point in my life. Please look at my <a href="" class="history-link">history</a> and <a href="" class="technical-link">technical</a> experience to get a more detailed story. Also take a look at my friends pages, <a href="http://www.brianspry.com">Brian Spry</a> and <a href="http://www.nortonwang.com">Norton Wang</a> if you have a chance.
